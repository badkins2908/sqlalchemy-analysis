# Surfs Up! SQLalchemy Analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis
This analysis was meant to assist an entreprenuer in opening his own surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. He is interested in what the temperature and percipitation levels are for the months of June and December, to determine if the weather best support surfing and/or ice cream.
